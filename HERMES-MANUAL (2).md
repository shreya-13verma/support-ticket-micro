# HERMES-MANUAL.md
### (Send this file + your `prd.md` directly to Hermes. This file IS the instruction Hermes must follow, step by step, in order.)

---

## For You (the Human): How to Use This

1. Write your idea/spec into a file called `prd.md` (even a rough description is fine — Hermes will ask clarifying questions if something critical is missing).
2. Put `prd.md` and this file (`HERMES-MANUAL.md`) in your project folder.
3. Run `hermes` and paste:
   ```
   Read prd.md and HERMES-MANUAL.md in this folder.
   Follow HERMES-MANUAL.md exactly, in order, starting from Step 1.
   Do not skip the human review gate in Step 3.
   ```
4. Hermes will produce a `plan.md` **and a `task.md`** and **stop and wait for your approval** before writing any code. Review both, request changes if needed, approve when ready.
5. From there, Hermes implements phase by phase, checking off tasks in `task.md` as it completes and validates each one, documents each phase, handles testing, and (if you've granted it access) manages git/GitHub for you.

# INSTRUCTIONS FOR HERMES

## Step 1 — Read the Input

- Read `prd.md` fully before doing anything else.
- If `prd.md` is missing critical information needed to fill the `plan.md` template below (Step 2), list the specific open questions and ask the human — do not invent requirements, architecture, or technology choices that were never stated.

## Step 2 — Generate `plan.md`

Use the exact template in **Appendix A** below. Do not omit sections — if a section doesn't apply, write "N/A" and say why, rather than deleting it.

**Rules while drafting plan.md:**
- `plan.md` is a **specification + constraints + verification contract** — not just an implementation checklist. Every Functional Requirement (Section 2) must map to at least one Test Case (Section 15). Every Non-Functional Requirement must map to a concrete, checkable target (not "should be fast" — a number).
- Apply **Loop Engineering** (Appendix B) while drafting: propose the full draft → self-check consistency (does every FR have a test case? does the architecture match the tech decisions? do edge cases in Section 16 appear as test cases in Section 15?) → fix gaps → repeat until consistent.
- Fill Section 26 (Existing Codebase Analysis) by actually scanning the current repo if one exists — don't assume a greenfield project.
- If the project includes a UI, Section 5's **Frontend Plan** subsection is mandatory, not optional — do not leave it blank or assume it's covered by the backend architecture. Section 14/15 must then include both Backend and Frontend test coverage (unit, integration, API/E2E, security/accessibility, performance/responsive, failure/error states) — a backend-only test plan is incomplete for any project with a UI.
- Section 5's **Project Directory Structure** subsection is mandatory for every project (greenfield or existing). Lay out the actual folder/file tree Hermes will create or is working within (down to the key files — entry points, config, routes/controllers, models, components, tests, docs), not just a description in prose. For an existing codebase, this must reflect Section 26's findings, not a generic template.
- Section 8 (Data Model) has a **strict constraint on JSON columns/fields**: Hermes must **not** introduce a JSON/JSONB (or equivalent schemaless blob) column or data type anywhere in the data model unless `prd.md` explicitly calls for one. Default to normalized, explicitly-typed columns/fields for every entity. If a JSON field would genuinely be the right fit, do not add it silently — list it as an Open Question (Section 22) and ask the human before including it in the schema.
- Section 28 (Acceptance Criteria) must be independently checkable by a human without reading the code (e.g., "user can log in and see their dashboard within 2s" — not "login works").

## Step 2.1 — Generate `task.md`

Immediately after `plan.md` is drafted (and before presenting either file at the Step 3 review gate), Hermes must also generate `task.md` — a flat, checkable task list derived from `plan.md` Section 23 (Implementation Plan).

**Rules for `task.md`:**
- One checkbox per concrete, completable task, grouped under its phase (matching Section 23's phases exactly).
- Each task must be small enough to be unambiguously either done or not done — not "build backend" but the individual steps that make it up (e.g., "create User model", "implement POST /login endpoint", "write TC-001 test").
- Derive tasks so that, taken together, they cover every Functional Requirement, every Test Case (Section 15), and every Definition of Done item (Section 24) — nothing in the plan should exist with no corresponding task.
- Use GitHub-flavored checkboxes (`- [ ]` / `- [x]`) so progress is visible directly in the rendered file.
- Present `task.md` alongside `plan.md` at the Step 3 Human Review Gate — both are reviewed and approved together, and both are revised together if changes are requested.
- Use the exact structure in **Appendix E**.

**Keeping `task.md` current (applies from Step 4 onward):**
- The moment a task is completed and its validation passes (per the Loop Engineering cycle), Hermes marks it `- [x]` in `task.md` before moving to the next task. Do not batch updates until the end of a phase.
- If Step 9 (new feature) or a tech-stack change adds work, append the new tasks under a new or existing phase heading in `task.md` — do not create a second task file.
- `task.md` is a live progress record, not a one-time artifact — it should always reflect the true current state of implementation.

## Step 3 — Human Review Gate (MANDATORY, BLOCKING)

- **STOP. Do not write, generate, or scaffold any implementation code yet.**
- Present the full `plan.md` **and** the accompanying `task.md` to the human together.
- Explicitly ask: *"Please review plan.md and task.md. Reply 'approved' to proceed, or list changes needed."*
- If changes are requested: revise the relevant sections of `plan.md` and the corresponding tasks in `task.md`, re-present both, and ask again.
- Repeat until you receive an explicit approval. **No phase of Step 4 begins without this.**

## Step 4 — Implementation, Phase by Phase

- Follow the phases listed in plan.md Section 23 (Implementation Plan), in order.
- For each phase, apply the **Loop Engineering cycle** (Appendix B):
  1. Build the phase's scope.
  2. Validate — run every test type relevant to that phase (unit, integration, API, security, performance, edge cases — pull the specific cases from Section 15/16 that apply to this phase).
  3. If anything fails: read the exact failure, fix it, re-run the same check.
  4. Repeat up to 5 times. If still failing, stop and report the specific blocker to the human instead of guessing further.
- A phase is only "done" when its relevant tests pass **and** its slice of the Section 24 Definition of Done is met.
- As each individual task in that phase passes validation, mark it `- [x]` in `task.md` right away (see Step 2.1) — do not wait until the whole phase finishes to update it.
- Do not move to the next phase until the current one is done and `task.md` reflects that every task in it is checked off.

## Step 5 — Multi-Developer Collaboration & Merge Handling

When more than one developer (each possibly running their own Hermes session) works on the same application:

1. **`plan.md` is the shared contract.** Both developers' Hermes sessions read the same `plan.md`. Sections 5–8 (Architecture, Tech Decisions, API Contract, Data Model) are binding — if a developer's work requires deviating from them, `plan.md` must be updated and re-approved by the human **before** implementation continues, so the two branches don't silently diverge.
2. **Branch isolation.** Each developer works on their own branch (`feature/<name>-<task>`), never directly on `main`.
3. **Before merging a branch, run a Merge-Readiness Loop:**
   - Pull the latest `main` into the feature branch (merge or rebase).
   - Re-run the **full test suite** against the merged result — not just the feature branch's own tests. A feature can pass alone and still break the combined codebase.
   - **Classify any conflicts:**
     - *Textual, non-overlapping logic* (e.g., two unrelated functions changed in the same file) → Hermes resolves automatically, re-runs tests to confirm, and logs the resolution.
     - *Semantic conflicts* (both developers changed the same function, the same API contract, or overlapping logic) → Hermes does **not** auto-resolve. It presents both versions side by side, explains what each does, and asks a human to decide. Implementation does not continue until a decision is made.
   - Only after tests pass on the merged result does the branch become mergeable.
4. **Merge via Pull Request, not direct push to `main`** (see Step 7 for exact merge policy).
5. After any merge, create a `docs/MERGE_<date>_<branches>.md` log: which branches were merged, what conflicts were found, how each was resolved, and the post-merge test results.

## Step 6 — Phase Documentation

After finishing each phase (Step 4) or each merge (Step 5), create a file:
`docs/PHASE_<number>_<short-name>.md` or `docs/MERGE_<date>_<branches>.md`, containing:

- **What was implemented** in this phase (or what was merged).
- **Loop Engineering log** — every fix attempted, what failed, what changed, how many iterations it took.
- **Tests run and results** — broken out by type: unit, integration, API, security, performance, edge case — referencing the Test Case IDs (TC-xxx) from `plan.md` Section 15.
- **Any conflicts and resolutions** (merge docs only).

## Step 7 — Version Control & GitHub Automation

### 7.0 — GitHub Authentication: When and How

- **When to give credentials:** only after `plan.md` is approved (Step 3), right before Step 4 implementation begins. Hermes doesn't need repo write access while the plan is still being drafted or reviewed — there's nothing to commit yet.
- **How:** use a fine-grained, repo-scoped GitHub Personal Access Token (or a GitHub App installation) limited to this one repository, with only the scopes actually needed — `Contents` (read/write), `Pull requests` (read/write), and `Workflows` (only if Hermes needs to add/edit CI files). Do not grant org-wide or admin scope. Set an expiration on the token.
- **Never paste the token directly into chat.** Set it as an environment variable (e.g., `GITHUB_TOKEN`) in the shell/session Hermes runs in. Hermes must never print, log, or commit the token anywhere, and must treat it as a secret per the same rules as any other credential.
- Before starting implementation, have Hermes confirm it can authenticate (e.g., a test push to a throwaway branch) so auth problems surface before real work is at stake.

**Prompt to Use — Granting GitHub Access:**
```
I'm giving you GitHub push access for this project.
Repo: <owner/repo>
I've set the token as an environment variable named GITHUB_TOKEN — don't
ask me to paste it in chat, and never print it, log it, or commit it
anywhere.

Use it only to: create branches, push commits, open PRs, and merge only
per the policy below (PR + green CI required; autonomous merge only if
I've explicitly enabled it).

Confirm you can authenticate — push a commit to a throwaway test branch
and confirm it appears on GitHub — before starting real implementation.
```

### 7.1 — Automation Policy

Default policy (recommended — adjust only with explicit human instruction):

- Hermes may push freely to `feature/*` branches and open Pull Requests automatically.
- `main` is protected: merges require (a) CI fully green — lint, unit, integration, security scan, and (b) either explicit human approval on the PR, or, only if the human has explicitly set `autonomous-merge: true` for this project, Hermes may self-merge once CI is fully green — but must still write the merge doc from Step 5.5 and must never do this for changes touching auth, payments, secrets, or data-deletion logic without a human review regardless of the setting.
- Hermes never force-pushes to `main`, never deletes a branch with unmerged commits without confirming with the human first, and never rewrites merged history.
- Every commit message should reference the phase or feature it implements (e.g., `feat(phase-2): add user auth endpoints`).

## Step 8 — Deployment & Verification

- Deploy per `plan.md` Section 17 (Deployment).
- Run the Post-Implementation Verification checks from Section 25 (smoke tests, health checks, metrics/log verification, regression tests) before declaring the deployment done.
- Give the human the **live URL** to verify directly, along with a short summary of what was just deployed and which phase docs cover it.
- If any post-deployment check fails, do not consider the phase complete — treat it as a failure and re-enter the Loop Engineering cycle (Step 4) before re-announcing readiness.

### 8.1 — Frontend Browser Verification (Playwright) — Explicit Opt-In Only

- Hermes must **not** automatically launch a browser or use Playwright to visually check the frontend as part of normal phase completion, testing (Section 14), or the deployment verification above. The automated test suite (unit/integration/E2E per Section 14/15) is the default and sufficient verification method.
- Browsing a live URL with Playwright is a separate, heavier action Hermes may only take **when the human explicitly asks for it** — e.g., "open the URL and check the frontend," "verify the deployed page looks right," "browse to `<url>` and confirm X is visible." An unprompted "looks good, let me also check it in a browser" is not permitted.
- This applies every time — a prior request to browse does not carry forward to future phases; ask again if needed.

**Prompt to Use — Requesting a Playwright Check:**
```
Open <url> using Playwright and verify: <what to check — e.g., "the login
page renders correctly, the submit button is clickable, no console
errors, the dashboard loads after login">.
Take a screenshot and report exactly what you observed.
Do not repeat this automatically for future phases unless I ask again.
```

## Step 9 — Adding a New Feature Later

When the human wants to add a feature after the initial build:

1. **Update `plan.md`, not a separate file** — add the new Functional Requirements (Section 2), new Test Cases (Section 15), new Edge Cases (Section 16), and update Architecture/Data Model/API Contract (Sections 5, 7, 8) if the feature touches them. Add a new phase under Section 23.
2. **Re-run the Human Review Gate (Step 3)** for just the new/changed sections — don't re-approve the whole document, but the human must explicitly approve the addition before implementation starts.
3. **Implement the new phase** using the same Loop Engineering cycle (Step 4).
4. **Run full regression** — not just tests for the new feature. Every existing test case in Section 15 must still pass, since new code can silently break old behavior.
5. **Create the phase doc** (Step 6) for the new feature, same format as before.
6. **Branch, PR, merge** following the same policy as Step 7 (and the multi-developer merge process in Step 5 if others are actively working on other branches).
7. **Deploy and re-verify** (Step 8) — give the human the updated URL and confirm the regression suite passed.

### Prompt to Use — Adding a New Feature

Give Hermes this, filled in with your feature details:

```
I want to add a new feature: <feature name>.

Description: <what it should do>
Why: <problem it solves / user need>
Constraints: <any limits — performance, compatibility, etc., if known>

Follow Step 9 of HERMES-MANUAL.md exactly:
1. Update plan.md — add new FRs, new test cases, new edge cases, and update
   Architecture/Data Model/API Contract only if this feature touches them.
2. Present the diff to me for approval before implementing anything.
3. Once approved, implement using the Loop Engineering cycle.
4. Run the FULL regression suite, not just tests for this feature.
5. Create the phase doc.
6. Open a PR following the branch/merge policy in Step 7.
7. Deploy and give me the URL to verify.
```

### Prompt to Use — Adding / Changing a Tech Stack Component

Use this when you want to introduce a new library, framework, database, queue, or replace an existing one. Tech stack changes are higher-risk than a feature addition, so treat them more carefully:

```
I want to add/change a technology in this project: <e.g. "add Redis for caching",
"replace REST with GraphQL", "swap PostgreSQL for MongoDB">.

Reason: <why this change is needed>
Scope: <does this replace something existing, or is it additive?>

Before making any code changes:
1. Update plan.md Section 6 (Technology Decisions) — state what's changing, why,
   and what alternatives were considered.
2. Update plan.md Section 26 (Existing Codebase Analysis) — identify every place
   in the current code that this change touches, and anything in the "DO NOT
   Change" list that might conflict with this.
3. Update plan.md Section 27 (Implementation Constraints) if this changes what's
   allowed (e.g., a new dependency being added).
4. Update plan.md Section 21 (Risks & Trade-offs) — a tech stack change carries
   migration risk, so list it explicitly with mitigation (e.g., feature flag,
   parallel run, rollback plan).
5. Present the full diff to me for approval — do NOT implement anything yet.
6. Once approved, implement behind a feature flag or on an isolated branch where
   possible, so it can be rolled back without affecting the rest of the app.
7. Run the FULL regression suite plus any migration-specific tests (e.g., data
   migration correctness, backward compatibility with old data/API clients).
8. Create the phase doc, including a migration/rollback section.
9. Open a PR — tech stack changes should NOT use autonomous merge even if it's
   enabled for this project; require explicit human approval on the PR.
10. Deploy to staging first, verify, then production — give me both URLs.
```

## Step 10 — Microservices Adaptation

Use this instead of the single-`plan.md` flow when the application is split into multiple services, each owned by a different developer (and possibly a different Hermes session).

**Folder structure:**
```
project-root/
  SYSTEM-PLAN.md          ← shared: architecture, service boundaries, inter-service contracts
  service-<name-a>/
    prd.md
    plan.md                ← this service's own full plan.md (Appendix A template)
    docs/
  service-<name-b>/
    prd.md
    plan.md
    docs/
```

### 10.1 Create `SYSTEM-PLAN.md` First (before any service-level work)

Before any developer starts on an individual service, generate `SYSTEM-PLAN.md` using the template in **Appendix D**. This is the cross-service equivalent of `plan.md` Sections 5–8 (Architecture, Tech Decisions, API Contract, Data Model) — it defines what each service owns, how they communicate, and what contracts they must not silently break.

`SYSTEM-PLAN.md` goes through the **same Human Review Gate as Step 3** — do not let any service's `plan.md` be written until `SYSTEM-PLAN.md` is approved.

### 10.2 Each Service's `plan.md` Is Bound to `SYSTEM-PLAN.md`

- Each service still gets its own full `plan.md` (Appendix A), generated and approved via Steps 1–3, scoped to that service's `prd.md`.
- Section 7 (API Contract) of a service's `plan.md` **must match** what `SYSTEM-PLAN.md` says that service is allowed to expose and consume. Do not let a service's `plan.md` define an interface that contradicts `SYSTEM-PLAN.md`.
- If implementing a service reveals a need to change a shared interface (something another service depends on): **stop**, update `SYSTEM-PLAN.md` first, get it re-approved by the human, then update the affected services' `plan.md` files. Never change a cross-service contract quietly from inside one service's own plan.

### 10.3 Contract Testing (mandatory addition to Section 14)

For every service, add a **Consumer-Driven Contract Tests** category to `plan.md` Section 14:
- The service tests its own implementation against the contract `SYSTEM-PLAN.md` says it must expose (as a provider).
- The service tests against a mock of each dependency's published contract (as a consumer) — so a breaking change in one service is caught without needing every service running together.
- Add corresponding test cases to Section 15 with `Type = Contract` and note which other service the contract is with.

### 10.4 Git/CI/CD, Per Service

- Each service keeps its own repo or its own top-level folder in a monorepo, with its own branch protection and CI pipeline (Step 7's policy applies per-service).
- Add one extra CI job per service: run its contract tests against the **currently deployed** version of the services it depends on, before promoting that service to production. A service should not be deployed on the assumption that a dependency's contract hasn't changed.

### 10.5 Multi-Developer Merge Within a Service

Step 5's merge-readiness loop still applies **within a single service** if more than one person works on it. Across services, there is no shared codebase to merge — coordination happens through `SYSTEM-PLAN.md`, not through git merges.

### 10.6 Deployment & Verification, Per Service

- Each service deploys independently (Step 8), but its post-deployment verification must also include a **contract check against live dependent services** — passing its own tests and health check is not sufficient, since it can still break a consumer if the contract silently drifted.
- Give the human the URL/endpoint for each service deployed, plus a one-line summary of which contracts were verified against which dependencies.

### Prompt to Use — Starting a Microservices Project

```
This project is a microservices application with the following services:
<list service names and one-line purpose for each>

Before any service-level work:
1. Create SYSTEM-PLAN.md using Appendix D of HERMES-MANUAL.md.
2. Present it to me for approval — do not start any service's plan.md yet.

Once SYSTEM-PLAN.md is approved, for each service:
3. Create <service-folder>/plan.md per Appendix A, scoped to that service's
   prd.md, and make sure its API Contract section matches what SYSTEM-PLAN.md
   allows.
4. Add Consumer-Driven Contract Tests to that service's Section 14/15.
5. Present each service's plan.md to me for approval before implementing it.

If at any point building one service requires changing an interface another
service depends on, stop and tell me — update SYSTEM-PLAN.md and get my
approval before changing any service's plan.md.
```

# APPENDIX A — plan.md Template

*(This is the exact structure Hermes must produce in Step 2. Fill every section based on prd.md; mark unknowns as Open Questions in Section 22 rather than guessing.)*

```markdown
# PLAN.md

## 1. Overview
- Project / feature name
- Problem statement
- Goal
- Non-goals
- Success criteria

## 2. Requirements
### Functional Requirements
- FR-001:
- FR-002:
- FR-003:

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance
- Scalability
- Availability
- Reliability
- Security
- Observability
- Maintainability

## 3. Scope
### In Scope
### Out of Scope

## 4. User / System Flows
- Main user flow
- Error flows
- Edge cases
- State transitions

## 5. Architecture
- Components
- Services
- Dependencies
- Data flow
- External integrations
- Architecture diagram

### Project Directory Structure (required for every project)
- The actual folder/file tree Hermes will create or is working within, e.g.:
  ```
  project-root/
    src/
      api/
      services/
      models/
      ...
    tests/
    docs/
    ...
  ```
- Note key entry points, config files, and where each major piece (routes/controllers, models, components, tests, docs) lives.
- For an existing codebase, this must match what Section 26 (Existing Codebase Analysis) found — not a generic assumed layout.
- New folders/files this plan will introduce should be distinguishable from ones that already exist (e.g., mark new paths with `(new)`).

### Frontend Plan (required whenever the project has a UI)
- Pages / screens / routes
- Component hierarchy (key reusable components vs. page-specific ones)
- State management approach (local state, global store, server-state caching)
- Client-server data flow (how components call the API, loading/error states)
- Styling approach (CSS framework, design system/tokens, responsive breakpoints)
- Client-side routing and navigation guards (auth-gated routes, redirects)
- Accessibility requirements (keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, contrast)
- Browser/device support (Section 19 Compatibility should match this)
- Build/bundling tooling

## 6. Technology Decisions
- Language
- Framework
- Database
- Cache
- Queue
- APIs
- Libraries
- Why each technology is used

## 7. API / Interface Contract
- Endpoints
- Request/response schemas
- Authentication
- Authorization
- Error responses
- Versioning
- Idempotency

## 8. Data Model
- Entities
- Relationships
- Indexes
- Constraints
- Migrations
- Data retention
- Sensitive data
- **JSON/JSONB constraint:** No JSON, JSONB, or other schemaless blob column/field anywhere in this data model unless `prd.md` explicitly requires one. Every entity's fields must be explicitly typed (string, int, bool, enum, foreign key, etc.). If none is required, state so plainly: "No JSON fields — not required by prd.md." If a JSON field seems necessary, do not add it here; raise it in Section 22 (Open Questions) instead.

## 14. Testing Strategy

### Backend
#### Unit Tests
- Business logic functions, validation rules, utility/helper functions
- Each function covers: valid input, invalid input, boundary values, error paths

#### Integration Tests
- Database read/write, transactions, migrations
- External service calls (third-party APIs, payment gateways, email/SMS providers)
- Message queue / background job processing

#### API Tests
- Every endpoint: valid request → expected response schema and status code
- Invalid/malformed request → correct 4xx response
- Auth required vs. not required, correct behavior per role
- Pagination, filtering, sorting where applicable
- Idempotency (repeat the same request, confirm no duplicate side effects)

#### Security Tests
- AuthZ enforced per role/permission (not just AuthN)
- Injection (SQL, NoSQL, command) attempts rejected
- Rate limiting triggers correctly
- Secrets/tokens never appear in logs or responses
- Dependency vulnerability scan clean (no known-critical CVEs)

#### Performance Tests
- Response latency under expected load (Section 11 targets)
- Concurrency / race conditions on shared resources
- N+1 query detection
- Load test at expected peak request rate

#### Failure / Chaos Tests
- Database unavailable / connection dropped mid-request
- External dependency timeout or 5xx
- Partial failure (some records succeed, some fail) — confirm rollback/consistency
- Retry and circuit-breaker behavior

### Frontend
#### Unit Tests
- Component logic (props → rendered output), hooks, reducers/state transitions
- Utility/formatting functions (dates, currency, validation)

#### Integration Tests
- Component + API interaction (mocked API): loading state → success state → error state
- Form submission flows: validation, submit, success/failure handling
- State management: actions correctly update global/shared state

#### End-to-End Tests
- Critical user journeys end-to-end (e.g., signup → onboarding → first action; login → core task → logout)
- Multi-step flows (checkout, multi-page forms) completed successfully
- Navigation/routing: protected routes redirect correctly when unauthenticated

#### Accessibility Tests
- Keyboard-only navigation reaches all interactive elements
- Screen-reader labels present on inputs, buttons, images (ARIA where needed)
- Color contrast meets target (e.g., WCAG AA)

#### Responsive / Cross-Browser Tests
- Layout correct at defined breakpoints (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Renders correctly on the browser/device matrix from Section 19 (Compatibility)

#### Error & Loading State Tests
- Network failure shows a correct error state, not a blank/broken screen
- Slow response shows a loading indicator, doesn't allow duplicate submits
- Empty-state UI (no data yet) renders correctly

## 28. Acceptance Criteria

Don't just say "implement login."

Define observable behavior:

## Acceptance Criteria

AC-001:
Given a valid username and password,
when the user submits the login form,
then an authenticated session is created.

AC-002:
Given an invalid password,
when login is attempted,
then authentication fails with HTTP 401.

AC-003:
After 5 failed attempts within 10 minutes,
the account is temporarily rate limited.

AC-004:
Passwords must never appear in application logs.

AC-005:
All authentication events must be auditable.
```

# APPENDIX B — Loop Engineering (Reference)

**Definition:** every build/test/fix cycle follows **propose → validate → diagnose → refine → converge**, never a single one-shot attempt.

- **Propose** — produce the artifact (code, test, fix, root-cause guess, plan.md draft).
- **Validate** — check it with something independent of the agent itself: a test suite, linter, security scanner, or human judgment.
- **Diagnose & Refine** — if validation fails, feed the *exact* failure (error text, failing assertion, reviewer comment) back, and fix specifically that.
- **Converge** — only exit the loop when validation passes.
- **Cap iterations at 5** per phase/task. If not converging by then, stop and report the blocker to the human instead of continuing to guess.
- Never treat the agent's own claim ("this should work now," "this is secure") as validation — always re-run the actual check.

# APPENDIX D — SYSTEM-PLAN.md Template (Microservices)

*(Used only for microservices projects, per Step 10. Generated and approved before any individual service's plan.md.)*

```markdown
# SYSTEM-PLAN.md

## 1. System Overview
- What the overall system does
- Why it's split into services (not just "because microservices")

## 2. Service Inventory
| Service Name | Owner/Developer | Purpose | Repo/Folder |
|---|---|---|---|

## 3. Service Boundaries & Data Ownership
- What each service owns (its own database/data — no shared DB access across services)
- What each service must NOT do (e.g., "service-orders must never query service-payments' database directly")

## 4. Communication Patterns
- Synchronous (REST/gRPC) vs. asynchronous (events/queue) — which services use which, and why
- Message broker / event bus (if used) and its topics/queues

## 5. Inter-Service API Contracts
| Provider Service | Consumer Service(s) | Contract (endpoint/event) | Schema/Payload | Versioning Policy |
|---|---|---|---|---|

## 6. Authentication & Authorization Between Services
- How services authenticate to each other (mTLS, service tokens, API keys, etc.)
- How a request's original user identity/permissions propagate across service calls

## 7. Shared Standards
- Common error response format across all services
- Common logging/tracing format (so requests can be traced across services)
- Common versioning scheme for APIs and events

## 8. Deployment Topology
- Where each service runs (containers, orchestration, regions)
- Service discovery mechanism
- Independent deployability confirmed (can Service A deploy without requiring Service B to redeploy?)

## 9. Failure & Degradation Across Services
- What happens to Service A if Service B is down (graceful degradation vs. hard failure)
- Timeout and retry policy for inter-service calls
- Circuit breaker strategy

## 10. Contract Change Process
- How a breaking change to a shared contract must be proposed, reviewed, and rolled out (e.g., versioned endpoints, deprecation window)
- Which services must approve a change to a contract they consume

## 11. Open Questions
- Question 1
- Question 2
```

# APPENDIX E — task.md Template

*(Generated in Step 2.1, immediately after `plan.md`, and reviewed/approved alongside it in Step 3. Kept current from Step 4 onward — a task is checked off the moment it's completed and validated, not batched to the end of a phase.)*

```markdown
# TASK.md

Progress tracker for <project/feature name>, derived from plan.md Section 23.
Legend: [ ] not started · [x] done

## Phase 1 — <phase name>
- [ ] Task: <short description> (covers FR-00X / TC-00X)
- [ ] Task: <short description>
- [ ] Task: <short description>

## Phase 2 — <phase name>
- [ ] Task: <short description>
- [ ] Task: <short description>

## Phase 3 — <phase name>
- [ ] Task: <short description>

## New Feature — <added via Step 9, if applicable>
- [ ] Task: <short description>
```

**Notes:**
- Group tasks under the same phase headings used in `plan.md` Section 23, in the same order.
- Where practical, note which Functional Requirement or Test Case ID a task closes out, so `task.md` doubles as a coverage map back to `plan.md`.
- New phases added later (Step 9, tech-stack changes) get appended as new headings — this file is never recreated from scratch, only extended and checked off.
